            <p>
                Initial exercise trying to get image from video for use in Canvas.

            <p>
                Based from previous sample, we are able to use the result to make texture for 3D mesh.

            <p>
                After reading the reference source below, I was inspired and wanted to make it.
                I adjusted a few line of codes since the threeJS library seem to be different versions.

            <p>
                The terrain is generated based from an image file.
                Change the image to generate a different terrain.
                Please note that this is not an efficient way to generate terrain.
                The page will take a few seconds to load.<br><br>
                You can use the mouse to navigate. Shit + drag to pan.
                Press space to fly.

            <p>
                The terrain is generated based on a noise function.
                This makes it faster and more efficient than the previous one.
                Check reference source below for more info.<br><br>
                I also added sakura trees randomly just above the waterline.

            <p>
                This is another study on procedural terrain generator based on some sample I saw somewhere.

            <p>
                This exercise is based on the reference source below.
                There are two concentric spheres that represent the Earth and atmosphere.
                Bump map is also applied to make the earth look realistic.<br><br>

                Floating box bobbing up and down above the waves.

                Perpetual bouncing ball. No physics. Just bouncing the object towards the opposite direction.
